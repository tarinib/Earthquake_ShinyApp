#####  Overview

An earthquake occurs when two blocks (tectonic plates) of the earth suddenly slip past one another. It is one of the most devastating natural hazards and can lead to a huge amount of loss of life and property in populated areas. However, since, the structure of the Earth's deep interior cannot be studied directly, earthquakes help us to understand earth's underlying layers. I have built a data visualization app that allows young students and educators or any curious mind to visually explore a dataset of significant earthquakes that occurred over a period of 50 years. My app shows the distribution of unique characteristics of each earthquake and allows users to explore different aspects of this data by filtering and plotting different variables in order to understand what kind of information these events can provide us with.

#### Description of the data

The dataset has been taken from [Kaggle Significant Earthquakes Data](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database). I have visualized the dataset of approximately 24,000 significant earthquakes (magnitude greater than 5.5) which occurred in period 1965-2016. This dataset has been provided by US Geological Survey. Each earthquake has 9 associated variable describing its time of occurrence (Date, Time), location (Latitude, Longitude), unique characteristics (ID, Depth, Magnitude) and category (Type, Magnitude Type).
